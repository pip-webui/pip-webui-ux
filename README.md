# <img src="https://github.com/pip-webui/pip-webui-ux/blob/master/assets/Logo.png" alt="Pip.WebUI Logo" style="max-width:30%"> <br/> UX Concept for LOB Applications

Irrelevant to implementation technology, user interactions in Line-Of-Business (LOB) applications 
follow similar patterns. Users held responsibilities over certain work areas. They need to constantly monitor 
and keep their areas under control. They receive, browse and analyze large volumes of ever changing data.
They do multi-tasking, handle distruptive events, collaborate with others inside and outside the system.

</div>

In this UX concept we put together principles and patterns extracted from multiple LOB applications. 
Then we mapped conceptual UX to different application design styles such as Microsoft Metro and Google Material.
Since nature of user interactions in LOB apps remains pretty stable, the high level of abtractions makes 
the concept future proof. We are planning to use it to emerging technologies such as voice interfaces,
virtual and augmented reality, touch tables and so on.
